## Courses Taught

Below is the list of courses I have taught at the University of British Columbia.

#### Undergraduate Courses

- **DSCI_V 100: Introduction to Data Science** Use of data science tools to summarize, visualize, and analyze data. Sensible workflows and clear interpretations are emphasized. [[syllabus](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/dsci-100-student/)][[R textbook](https://datasciencebook.ca/)] [[Python textbook](https://python.datasciencebook.ca/)]

- **DSCI_V 310: Reproducible and Trustworthy Workflows for Data Science**
Data science methods to automate the running and testing of code and analytic reports, manage data analysis software dependencies, package and deploy software for data analysis, and collaborate with others using version control.

## Teaching Philosophy

As a result of my experiences,
I have come to believe the most important things that an educator can do 
to facilitate student learning 
is to provide motivation for what is being learned, 
build a respectful 
and supportive community for learners, 
as well as embody responsiveness in their teaching and classroom management. 
In prioritizing these three aspects of my teaching 
I hope that I inspire curiosity in the subjects I teach, 
create a safe and collaborative learning space, 
as well as reduce friction and barriers to learning. 

#### Motivation
I believe that motivation is important for successful learning, 
as it can energize, direct, and sustain it. 
One way I motivate students in the classroom 
is by beginning the presentation of any new topic 
with real-world problems that they will be able to solve 
after they master the content and skills we are embarking upon learning. 
The problems I choose are modern, and relevant to the real world. 
I often draw these from the Master of Data Science (MDS) Capstone projects. 
I choose accessible problems,
which do not require too much domain expertise 
so that this does not distract from learning 
the ***data science***^[**Data science:** the process of extracting insight from data through reproducible 
and auditable methods.] concepts and skills needed for solving the problem. 

Another motivational tactic that I use is live demonstrations 
of the data products they will build 
to solve the problems they are learning about. 
I show them the finished product (*e.g.*, a beautiful data visualization, 
a data analysis pipeline, a software package), illustrate how it is used, 
and then pass the product to the students and let them use it. 
I choose demonstrations that are beautiful, 
that clearly would take a long time to run, 
or that would be very brittle if not automated. 
I also provide story-like narration with the demonstrations, 
describing the need for the data product, 
the intended audience for the product 
and why creating the product in such a way as we did 
(usually using ***reproducible***^[**Reproducible analysis:** an analysis where the
same result can be reached given the same input, computational methods, 
and conditions] and ***transparent**/**auditable***^[**Transparent/Auditable analysis:** an analysis
where there is a readable record of the steps used to carryout the analysis 
(*i.e.*, computer code) as well as a record of how the analysis methods evolved 
(*i.e.,* a version controlled project history).] methods) 
has advantages over creating it in other ways. 
Once this motivation is in place, 
students are keen to learn how to solve the presented problems 
with the products I demonstrate; their brains are primed for learning. 

#### Building of a respectful and supportive community for all learners
From my experience, the building of a respectful and supportive community 
for learners is fundamental for levelling the playing field 
across a group of heterogeneous learners - 
which is essentially any group of learners. 
In a classroom where a respectful and supportive community is not built, 
only some learners who have certain privileges are likely to succeed. 
In such an unsafe environment, 
many learners lacking these certain privileges will become demotivated, 
frustrated, and feel alone. 
Their learning will suffer because of this, 
no matter how well the content is delivered by the teacher. 
Thus, for each group of learners I teach, I strive to provide scaffolding 
and guidance to enable the building of a respectful 
and supportive community for learners using several strategies. 

One thing I do is to provide each group of learners a code of conduct 
that clearly outlines what behaviours are not acceptable in our learning spaces, 
and a process for reporting a code of conduct violation. 
Importantly, I provide contact details for a secondary reporting person, 
other than myself, 
in case I am the one to (unintentionally) violate the code of conduct. 
Another example of how I try to create a respectful and supportive community 
is through the use of group projects and assignments.

I use randomly assigned groups to encourage learners to interact with others 
that they might not typically interact with (due to unconscious biases). 
To facilitate groups working well together, 
I have them draft a teamwork contract together in their first co-working session. 
Additionally, students are made aware they will receive a teamwork grade, 
that is in part informed by their teammates reports 
on how well they worked together. 
This social scaffolding around a typically challenging task (group work) 
helps facilitate the building of collegial 
and social relationships between learners, 
and strengthens the community beyond the work done in the group project.

#### Responsive teaching and classroom management
I also believe that responsiveness in teaching is critical to supporting learning. 
Each group of learners is different - 
even two sections of the same course being taught at the same time. 
Furthermore, the world around us is constantly changing. 
I am writing this teaching statement in the midst of the global pandemic of 2020/21 - 
which is the greatest societal shift I have ever lived through. 
The amount of required flexibility and responsiveness 
to policies and procedures, technological tools, student capacity, 
and teacher capacity from March 2020 - onward, 
when our university shifted to teaching online 
in less than a week's time was incredible. 
Embracing responsiveness and flexibility as a teacher in this situation 
clearly helped support my students through this extremely challenging time. 
And in reflection, 
I see that responsiveness in teaching has always been critically important, 
however I am only now appreciating and emphasizing this fully.
