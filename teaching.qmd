## Teaching Philosophy

I’ve learned that great teaching isn't just about delivering content—it's about creating the right conditions for learning to happen. My approach rests on three core pillars: sparking genuine motivation, building a supportive community, and staying flexibly responsive to my students' needs. When I get these right, I see curiosity catch fire, collaboration flourish, and obstacles to learning start to fall away
