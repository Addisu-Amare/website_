# The Future of Medical Imaging
Medical imaging is evolving. Artificial intelligence is no longer a simple tool; in fact, it has become part and parcel of diagnostic workflows. There is a growing need for intelligent processing of medical images, which represent approximately 90% of all healthcare data.

# The Problem
Radiologists: Are experiencing a 30-40% increase in workload each year

Imaging technology: High-resolution, 3D and 4D images are becoming more common

Diagnostic Accuracy: Error rates due to human interpretation can be as high as 30% in some instances

# How AI solves these problems
Two significant advances have been made with respect to using AI in medical imaging - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have become the standard when it comes to the majority of medical imaging techniques and algorithms.
