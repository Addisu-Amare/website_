This work describes research and development as well as validation of an innovative integrated device designed to allow individuals to obtain four critical physiological readings (heart rate (HR), blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂), glucose level, and body temperature) using only their fingertips with no invasion whatsoever. The system is built using multiple types of sensors such as the MAX30100 pulse oximeter for measuring HR and SpO₂ and the MLX90614 infrared sensor for measuring body temperature. For obtaining glucose level estimates, we created a new custom near-infrared (NIR) optical module. The embedded core of our system consists of an Arduino microcontroller and a NodeMCU (ESP8266) which perform all the required operations of the system including real-time signal acquisition, filtering, sensor fusion, and data processing of the measured data. Upon processing, the system sends the processed data wirelessly via Wi-Fi to a special application running on an Android device allowing for quick access to the user's health data, tracking of health data over time, and providing users with the ability to store, manage, and review their health data. Experimental data from our prototype indicates that it successfully measures real-time data and provides accurate measurements of HR, SPO₂, and body temperature as well as a promising correlation between the use of NIR technology and estimating trends in glucose level. Overall, we successfully built a low-cost and user-friendly prototype that provides a comprehensive non-invasive method for users to monitor multiple physiologic parameters and represents an important advance towards developing comprehensive point-of-care diagnostics in the future.\n\n# 1. Introduction\nThe main objective of this project is to design and demonstrate a non-invasive multi-physiological parameter monitoring system by using an IR sensor, pulse oximetry sensor, and IR temperature sensor. The motivation for this work arises from the crowding of hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, where remote monitoring of heart rate and oxygen levels is critical for patient care. Fever is often the body's first reaction to infection, making non-contact temperature measurement a vital tool for early disease detection. Furthermore, traditional glucose monitoring is often painful and invasive; this project proposes a non-invasive method to relieve patient discomfort.\n\n# 2. Project Description and Goals\nThis project focuses on a portable, cost-effective system for monitoring diabetic patients, with a specific emphasis on non-invasive blood glucose prediction. The system utilizes Near Infrared (NIR) light to irradiate the fingertip, measuring how glucose levels modulate light transmission. \n\nThe primary goals include:\n*   Designing a low-cost, multi-parameter device.\n*   Implementing reflectance sensing for heart rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2%) to enable wrist-wearability.\n*   Investigating NIR light for blood glucose prediction.\n*   Integrating local OLED display and wireless transmission via the Blynk IoT platform.\n\n# 3. Technical Specifications\nThe system incorporates several hardware components:\n*   **Microcontrollers:** Esp8266 Node MCU and Arduino Nano.\n*   **Sensors:** MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter, MLX90614 IR Temperature Sensor, APDS-9960 Proximity Sensor, and a Photoelectric IR Sensor.\n*   **Display:** 0.96-inch SSD1306 OLED with 128×64 pixels.\n*   **Software:** Blynk mobile app, Arduino IDE, and Excel.\n\n# 4. Methodology\nThe device utilizes both reflectance and transmissive methodologies. In the reflectance approach, LEDs and photodiodes are placed side-by-side on the skin; light is absorbed by the blood and reflected back to the sensor to measure SpO2 and BPM. For glucose monitoring, a polynomial regression equation was derived from a study of 24 individuals to relate analog voltage ($x$) to glucose level ($y$): $y = (8 \\times 10^{-5})x^2 + 0.1873x + 46.131$.\n\n# 5. Results and Discussion\nTests conducted on six students showed glucose measurements ranging from 100 mg/L to 120 mg/L after lunch, all falling within normal medical ranges. The system successfully displayed real-time data on the OLED and transmitted values to the Blynk app. \n\n### Cost Analysis\nThe total cost of the prototype was calculated at 2115 rupees. A cost comparison revealed that while the custom-built pulse oximeter component (580 rupees) is significantly cheaper than commercial versions (over 3000 rupees), the IR temperature monitoring component (1237 rupees) was more expensive than some commercial \"temperature guns\" found on the market.\n\n# 6. Summary\nThis work presents a non-invasive system to predict blood glucose, body temperature, blood oxygen, and pulse rate. Utilizing Arduino and Node MCU with NIR technology, the device offers a quick, easy, and cost-effective method for health monitoring that avoids the pain of invasive testing.\n\n# 7.
