    "text": "Abstract The development of portable non-invasive health monitoring systems is very important to improving both personal and preventive health care through telemedicine. This work describes research and development as well as validation of an innovative integrated device designed to allow individuals to obtain four critical physiological readings (heart rate (HR), blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂), glucose level, and body temperature) using only their fingertips with no invasion whatsoever. The system is built using multiple types of sensors such as the MAX30100 pulse oximeter for measuring HR and SpO₂ and the MLX90614 infrared sensor for measuring body temperature. For obtaining glucose level estimates, we created a new custom near-infrared (NIR) optical module. The embedded core of our system consists of an Arduino microcontroller and a NodeMCU (ESP8266) which perform all the required operations of the system including real-time signal acquisition, filtering, sensor fusion, and data processing of the measured data. Upon processing, the system sends the processed data wirelessly via Wi-Fi to a special application running on an Android device allowing for quick access to the user’s health data, tracking of health data over time, and providing users with the ability to store, manage, and review their health data. Experimental data from our prototype indicates that it successfully measures real-time data and provides accurate measurements of HR, SPO₂, and body temperature as well as a promising correlation between the use of NIR technology and estimating trends in glucose level. Overall, we successfully built a low-cost and user-friendly prototype that provides a comprehensive non-invasive method for users to monitor multiple physiologic parameters and represents an important advance towards developing comprehensive point-of-care diagnostics in the future.\nKeywords: Non-invasive, Sensor,Near-infrared, NodeMCU, HR,SPO2."

When I get these right, I see curiosity catch fire, collaboration flourish, and obstacles to learning start to fall away"
