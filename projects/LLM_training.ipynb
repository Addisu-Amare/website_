        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, you will learn how to finetune large language models with limited GPU memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the last few years models have greatly increased in size and many of them do not fit onto the standard consumer GPU, not said about finetuning these models in conventional way.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, there exists several techniques that allow one to inference and even finetune large models given modest resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reduction of the model size**\n",
        "\n",
        "There existst numerous approaches to model compression (that require a separate lecture for an overview) and the one of the most succesfull in the context of LLM is PTQ (post-training quantization) that stores the weight in low precision.\n",
        "\n",
        "4-bit quantization typically leads to minor degration in performance relative to the floating point baseline offerring huge memory savings:\n",
        "* a model in `half` precision requires `16 bits` per parameter\n",
        "* a model quantized to 4-bits requires `4+eps bits` per parameter (there is small overhead on the storage of quantization statistics)\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, we have almost `4x` reduction in memory!\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reduction of the memory on optimizer states**\n",
        "\n",
        "Another challenge are the optimizer states. For `Adam` optimizer commonly adopted for training Transformers one needs `4 bytes` for gradients, and first and second optimizer moment (one may try to store some of these in half precision, but it tends to incur instability).\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, the total memory required to train something like `Llama-7b`, `Mistral-7b`, `gemma-7b` exceeds `80Gb` of high-end `A100, H100`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finetuning only the `lm.head` may not suffice for more complicated tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus we search for something in between - that allows to adapt in some sense every transformer layer, but with small number of trainable parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Different approach to train small subset of parameters are known in the literature as **parameter-efficient finetuning** (PEFT) methods.\n",
