their brains are primed for learning. \n\n#### Building of a respectful and supportive community for all learners\nFrom my experience, the building of a respectful and supportive community \nfor learners is fundamental for levelling the playing field \nacross a group of heterogeneous learners - \nwhich is essentially any group of learners. \nIn a classroom where a respectful and supportive community is not built, \nonly some learners who have certain privileges are likely to succeed. \nIn such an unsafe environment, \nmany learners lacking these certain privileges will become demotivated, \nfrustrated, and feel alone. \nTheir learning will suffer because of this, \nno matter how well the content is delivered by the teacher. \nThus, for each group of learners I teach, I strive to provide scaffolding \nand guidance to enable the building of a respectful \nand supportive community for learners using several strategies. \n\nOne thing I do is to provide each group of learners a code of conduct \nthat clearly outlines what behaviours are not acceptable in our learning spaces, \nand a process for reporting a code of conduct violation. \nImportantly, I provide contact details for a secondary reporting person, \nother than myself, \nin case I am the one to (unintentionally) violate the code of conduct. \nAnother example of how I try to create a respectful and supportive community \nis through the use of group projects and assignments.\n\nI use randomly assigned groups to encourage learners to interact with others \nthat they might not typically interact with (due to unconscious biases). \nTo facilitate groups working well together, \nI have them draft a teamwork contract together in their first co-working session. \nAdditionally, students are made aware they will receive a teamwork grade, \nthat is in part informed by their teammates reports \non how well they worked together. \nThis social scaffolding around a typically challenging task (group work) \nhelps facilitate the building of collegial \nand social relationships between learners, \nand strengthens the community beyond the work done in the group project.\n\n#### Responsive teaching and classroom management\nI also believe that responsiveness in teaching is critical to supporting learning. \nEach group of learners is different - \neven two sections of the same course being taught at the same time. \nFurthermore, the world around us is constantly changing. \nI am writing this teaching statement in the midst of the global pandemic of 2020/21 - \nwhich is the greatest societal shift I have ever lived through. \nThe amount of required flexibility and responsiveness \nto policies and procedures, technological tools, student capacity, \nand teacher capacity from March 2020 - onward, \nwhen our university shifted to teaching online \nin less than a week's time was incredible. \nEmbracing responsiveness and flexibility as a teacher in this situation \nclearly helped support my students through this extremely challenging time. \nAnd in reflection, \nI see that responsiveness in teaching has always been critically important, \nhowever I am only now appreciating and emphasizing this fully.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Courses Taught\n\nBelow is the list of courses I have taught at the University of British Columbia.\n\n#### Undergraduate Courses\n\n- **DSCI_V 100: Introduction to Data Science** Use of data science tools to summarize, visualize, and analyze data.
